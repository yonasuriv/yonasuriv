## Hey! I'm Jonathan ü§ò

I'm a Computer Science student who have a passion for cybersecurity (ethical hacking), AI and Robotics.
The upcoming web 3.0 with the blockchain technology is what I aim to make a change in the world. (a.k.a the fourth industrial revolution)

I love ideas and being part of those who manage to carry them out. In my free time I like to do extreme sports and philosophize.
