I'm a Full Stack Developer currently working on the Web 3.0 with a penchant for Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence.

Inspired by curiosity, that is what drives me. I am extremely passionate about technology and its correct use to improve the society.        
Always eager to learn, grow as a professional and as a person while doing my best to contribute to the world and to my colleagues.

I love ideas and being part of those who manage to carry them out. In my free time I like to do extreme sports and philosophize.
